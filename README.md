# Goodsted Opportunities Clone

I cloned the page ["https://staging.goodsted.com/opportunities"] using React. 


# Aspects 

All data (and filtered data) is fetched from Goodsted API. Therefore, all data shown is up to date and all filters works exactly how they should. The cloned webpage is responsive to all screen sizes. Altough the clone looks very similar with the original page, this is not pixel-perfect.


# Running The Project
As a prerequisite, Node.js should be installed.

First, in order to install required node packages, run this command in the project folder:
```bash
npm install
```

After the packages are installed, run:
```bash
npm start
```
This command will run the app in the developement mode. After that, open [http://localhost:3000/] to view the page in the browser.
